<pre>smile

peel back your grinning face and be
my second life again
to be forbidden everything
to straddle and pretend

my heart is prone to failing
the blood reciprocates
replaces both its living
and its purities with fate

so dull to live forever
so right to live to die
a cut string's always severed
a dead light never lies</pre>
