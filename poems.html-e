<p>This is a bunch of poems that I wrote. Here is a list of what is below:</p>
<p>chrysalis cuddle tides fragility smile</p>

<pre>chrysalis

i've a blossom in me that nobody knows
an expectant flower waits as the sun glows
though hidden down under cover of darkness
with ignorant hopes that the blossom will die
if it feeds on nothing but salt when I cry
hope it withers and stagnates as a dead cyst

but i hope the blossom grows parasitically
sucks the bloom from my body the blood from my lips
sucks the life from my flesh and the lunar eclipse
just let me lie forever dead and alone
in the bottom of someone's deserted tomb
i'll excavate my own place to inhabit
and all of you can stay away from me

why emerge and destroy the illusion of self
all paths lead to death all paths lead to death
my heart expands growing surely inwards
within the safe cocoon
the heart's vessels become crazy figures

until i lose myself in the mass of bodies
become everyone else, complaining, ornery
but the carapace stays and the blossom's not gone
as long as I live I will keep to the shadows
to strangle its growth and pretend to be facile
but the carapace stays and the blossom's not gone

trapped in shadows in shadows lengthening lengthening 
like a summer sunset slickening slickening
a winter front moving in like a bad dream
melding to myself endlessly there's no identity
here we are everything, nothing, whatever we
want; as long as we maintain the scream</pre>

<pre>cuddle [hat tip to fineshrine]

get a little closer; let it fill
cut open my sternum and pull
my little ribs apart too
oh let me envelop you

i need to be held still
cut open my beating heart and pull
my sinews all around you
the blood swelling in red pools

my body blankets for the cold
cut my fat into warm holes
my little ribs around you
my wet parts all surround you
cut into my sternum and pull
deconstruct my mind to be dull
destroy me once you're full
let me rot away until

you love me forever still
slide into my bleeding heart and pull
my sinews all around you
the blush welling in red pools </pre>

<pre>tides

life
is like
a box of
chocolates
as long as the
candies are black
and the blood filling
siphoned from my veins
drips quiet onto the ground
with frenzied streams of bile -
and if I could get myself to throw
up any more I would stick my fingers
into my throat wholeheartedly
panic with familiar anxiety
everybody is so angry
they all need to calm
down and relax like
we used to at the
old summer house
watching tides
recede</pre>

<pre>fragility

my heart is made of glass
and my skin is made of foam
pressing harshly on the surface
bends and warps the bubbled dome
my veins are showing in my hands
a million trailing ampersands
and, and, and, and, and ...</pre>

<pre>smile

peel back your grinning face and be
my second life again
to be forbidden everything
to straddle and pretend

my heart is prone to failing
the blood reciprocates
replaces both its living
and its purities with fate

so dull to live forever
so right to live to die
a cut string's always severed
a dead light never lies</pre>
