Around twenty cars were in the expansive parking lot, situated near a suburban clusterfuck of a suburb in mid-April: my car was one of those, a small 1990's-era Mazda Miata with enough room for a guy and a bundle of groceries in the side seat. Everything looked like it'd be a normal day as I entered: the only foggy spot was this meteor that the news was reporting would land vaguely around the city I was in. I didn't pay it much attention, though: the effective landing radius was dozens of miles. Even if I'd tried to scan the sky for it I don't think I would've seen it: the sky is big, bigger than I wish it was, and it's almost impossible to analyze.\n	Wonder Bread and $2 packages of frozen vegetables to throw into the rice cooker, rice, ramen … I check things off my list haphazardly, wandering between the stacks of food – until I have all my condiments, my supplies. There's a bunch of candy in the front of the store. I think about it, waffle, then head there, picking up a package of Swedish Fish and weighing whether I should purchase it in my hands. The result is inconclusive.\n	That's when it hit. \n	The ceiling of the store ruptured. I looked at it – I remember being almost unconcerned, initially, as the first spores spread, light blue things that attached themselves to everything in eyesight. I moved, slowly at first, towards the exit, preceded by the one or two people who were screaming as soon as they saw the things and were dashing away to their cars. Nobody was following me, though. I stopped at the apex and realized that everybody else in the store was stopped, was letting the spore do what it wanted. It seemed inevitable. But I wouldn't let it happen.\n	I abandoned my cart inside – no stealing – and started to run out of the store, through the parking lot instead of to my car, blue spores falling all around me as though they were a heavy rain. The grocery store itself, behind me, started to buck and squeal at its edges horrendously, as though it was a building that'd just realized that buildings themselves couldn't be made: they were impossible, their functions were useless. It was tearing itself apart, piece by piece, with terrible grinding sounds, to prove its hypothesis.\n	I wasn't wearing anything but a pair of jeans, loose white t-shirt, and shoes. I started to dash away but realized that one of the spores had landed on my hand, and with a surprised yelp swatted it off of me. But it'd changed my hand somehow: it was now smooth and light blue, singular, and it'd left residue of some sort.\n	And the residue was slowly spreading, I could feel it, slipping up my arm with the cold tingle that you feel when you slip your hand into a pool of water. Running wouldn't work, now. It was useless. I was infected – with whatever this blue stuff was. But I didn't know what to do but run from it. So I ran. The blue spores fell on the ground behind me – I tried to dodge them. It was like dodging raindrops in a heavy storm, but it was somehow working –  I didn't get hit again. \n	I darted down a street lined with houses – the flood was less severe there, and it seemed like it was calming down outside of the grocery store, like it'd done what it needed to. After a block and a turn into a nearby alley I slowed to a walk, looking around for any more signs of whatever that blue stuff was, and itched at the blueness with my other, “clean” hand – the blueness wasn't covering my hand, anymore, but my whole arm, the arm shockingly smooth and different, spreading. I scratched my shoulder, too, slipping my hand into my sleeve – it was so smooth and so itchy, and scratching it felt good somehow. When I took my right hand out from under the sleeve, though, it too had been turned into a blue smoothness by the stuff.\n	I leaned against an alley and put a hand over my chest as though it'd calm my heart or slow it down, breathing in and out, glancing behind me. Maybe it'd just been a trick of the light. Maybe I was just hallucinating this. It couldn't be real. I heard a sound from the direction I'd run from and looked harder.\n	Houses started to crack behind me: I could see them, I could see the cracks spreading. I saw a garage fall into the ground and my eyes opened wide - I turned to run again even though I was changing – some part of me was telling me to stop, more of me than was telling me to run, but the part telling me to run was so panicked that I listened to it and ran as though the wind itself was behind me. The buildings behind me, houses, garages, fissured and practically disappeared: it was as though they just decided to stop existing and sank into the ground, one by one down the block. As I ran the rate that the buildings were falling began to increase. \n	Looking ahead of me at the mouth of the alley's exit, I saw three people – each with the telltale blue shimmer that showed that they'd been infected with whatever it was. I stopped, torn on whether I should try to barrel past them of if they'd capture me, but they didn't seem to care or even notice that I was there past amusement - one of them caught a glimpse of me as they passed, and looked like she was going to say something, but didn't. \n	I continued running, though I was confused now, and the blueness was still spreading and it felt cold and yet hot: it felt like it was alive, kicking and screaming, some sort of self-aware organism. And it was doing something beyond the change to my arm and hand, beyond everything else. As I reached the mouth of the alley my legs locked up and I fell to the ground: I felt as though I was having a seizure, and the cold blueness passed over me.\n	I stayed there convulsing on the ground for a minute. When I stopped, I could see the group of three people looking at me with concern – they'd looped back around to double-check on me, two guys and a girl. I blinked and looked around me. Everything felt … weird.\n	“You okay?” asked one of the guys, extending a hand to me. I took it, groaning, pushing myself off of the floor with the effort.\n	“Uh … uh,” I said, not entirely sure what to say from that. It was cold, and the shirt's coarseness hadn't hurt before – but it was actively uncomfortable now. Everything was softer. “I guess ...” I said, trailing off.\n	Suddenly the girl looked at one of her arms. I could see it: it'd turned blue, a darker blue than mine. “What the hell?”\n	“Kelly, you okay?” one of the guys said, touching the arm. She was looking at it horrified.\n	“Don't TOUCH me!” she said, moving her arm away, but it didn't do anything – even though the blueness spread through him, he was unaffected. She fell on the ground and began to spasm. I looked on, horrified.\n	One of the guys grabbed me. “What did you DO to her?” he yelled into my face, and I winced.\n	“Nothing!” I said, panicky. “I didn't do anything!”\n	“Change it back!” he said, grabbing me by the arms, then shaking me. “Change it back!”\n	“Change WHAT?!” I said, yelling. “I don't know what's going ON!”\n	He let my left hand go and brought his right hand back. I brought it up to my face, and he punched me, still holding onto me with the other hand – I caught it but it still propelled the back of my hand into my face, impacting. It hurt. I was too shocked to say anything.\n	“Change her BACK!” he said, and punched me again. But I caught it, better this time, and started blocking his punches, which were wild. I grabbed both of his arms for a second and looked at the other guy.\n	“Make sure the girl's okay.” I said. He nodded. The other guy wrenched his arms free and swung at me: I dodged one, but not the other, and landed dazed on the ground.\n	Kelly coughed on the ground, and stirred. Everyone's eyes went to her. She was entirely blue, too.\n	“Oh, fuck.” the other guy said, kneeling down. “Are you okay?”\n	She got up slowly, getting into a sitting position, still getting his bearings. “... What the hell is this?”\n	“I think it's the spores,” I said, getting up. “... They're doing … something.”\n	She got up and walked to me. “... Who hit you?” she said, brushing the hair from my face, touching it. I looked at the guy who'd done it, who looked as though his eyes were popping out of his head.\n	“He did,” I said, pointing. “It's okay, though. … He thought I did that to you.”\n	“Oh,” she said, and then the cement on the street was ripped up underneath our feet, though we didn't really fall – suddenly we were just … lower, and the two other guys fell away from us and were gone. We landed in a pile of dirt.\n	“What happened?” she said, crawling up.\n	“I have no idea,” I said, looking around us and then at her. “We should probably get to the grocery store.”\n	“Why the store?” she asked.\n	“That's where it started,” I said. “It came out of the sky.”\n	She looked skeptically at me, then nodded. “What's your name, anyways? Don't think I caught it.”\n	“Uh.” I said, again, as we began to walk to the store. “Kyle.”\n	“That's a go-” she started to say, before there was a gigantic tearing noise.\n	The house next to us disappeared into the ground. Behind us, the sewer system was suddenly exposed in the ground: it was tearing -everything- out, and you could see the dirt falling into the system behind us. Everything below our feet was crackling with that sort of sound that suggested it was about to collapse.\n	“RUNNING NOW!” I said, and started to run – she ran besides me, and I grabbed my hand and ran alongside. The world was falling away behind us, bit by bit, but slowly enough that it was obvious the thing – whatever it was – just wanted us at the store, and it wanted us there /now/. As we both stepped onto a piece of concrete it was flung far ahead - we rode it, together, like a surfboard through the sky, until we both thudded heavily into a massive mountain of dirt. I slowly dug my head out of the dirt, looking around, blinking, and tried to get my bearings.\n	She landed face-first into the dirt above me, then tumbled down, landing on me as he fell – I instinctively grabbed her, and she grabbed back. Though I almost fell down the mountain myself I didn't, though I was dragged to standing, and she looked up at me with a smile.\n	“... Thanks,” she said, getting to her feet.\n	“No problem,” I said, smiling back at her. “This shit is so crazy … we have to help each other out when we can, right?”\n	“Yeah,” she said, scratching her head. “Yeah.” Then the mountain moved.\n	“Shit!” I said, as I fell. The hill somehow became steeper, and again we were rolling down. She grabbed me, and I grabbed back - we both went up and down in the descent, hitting the dirt multiple times, and generally getting the wind taken out of us before landing at the bottom in a heap. I was on top of her. She'd cushioned my fall.\n	“Owwwwwww.” she groaned.\n	“Oh my god, sorry, sorry,” I said hurriedly, getting up and extending a hand to her. She took the hand, and I dragged her to her feet. She bobbed about like a punch-drunk boxer.\n	“Feel like I've just been beaten to death,” she mumbled, blinking. \n	I grabbed her by the shoulders and started to guide her off. Holding her up, I looked around. The vegetables, the genetically modified ones, had disappeared: everything had disappeared. There was nothing but the brown dirt below us and around us, the dirt being a reasonable facsimile for the store's walls – though there wasn't an exit. After a few moments, she stopped leaning into me and looked around.\n	“Can we get out?” she said, wonderingly. I shrugged, and tried halfheartedly to gain purchase in the wall's dirt, but it fell away from my feet before seemingly sliding back into place, immovable.\n	“Don't think so,” I said.\n	“We're going to starve here,” she said miserably, plopping into the ground.\n	“We're not going to starve here.” I said, confidently. “I know it.”\n	“You know it?”\n	“Just trust in it, okay?” I said and patted her hand. Our eyes met, and we both blushed and looked away.\n	“... Okay,” she said, softly, looking back up.\n	We sat and watched the sun rise and fall, wordlessly.\n	I was sleeping when I was awakened in the middle of the night by something pressing up between my shoulder blades. I sleepily rolled over to see what it was, and rolled onto some other green, leafy thing – the place I'd been sleeping on was some growing plant, and looked the worse for wear by my sleeping. A few of the plants had already grown: I looked around at the makeshift garden in some wonder and took a grape from a small, growing grape bush, popping it into my mouth and sucking on it. It was good, citrus-y. I poked the girl: she stirred, slowly, then woke up blinking.\n	“Huh?”\n	“We have grapes,” I said with a smile, picking another, still tasting the first one – it was different from grapes I'd had before, somehow more vibrant, more there. She rolled herself into a sitting position, and I handed her a grape – she looked at it, seemingly analyzing it, then popped it into her mouth, chewing.\n	“... Grapes.” she said, baffled. I started to laugh. After a second, she joined me, sitting there with nothing but the stars to light the garden growing underneath us. I lay on my back, still laughing: she lay down, her head next to mine: and all I could see were the stars, clearer than they'd ever been before, shining down on us, benevolent.\n	The stars.\n(these are to be continued. for now you can just go to the good ending.)\n[[be]]\n\n[[cont]]</div><div tiddler="falling rain" tags="" modified="201301241950" created="201301241950" modifier="twee">all individual\ndroplets of misery\nchoke the life out of me\nto pointless [[empathy]]\ndon't make me [[repeat]]\nwhat I said before\nwe are [[all the same]]\neven if we want [[more|refrain]]</div><div tiddler="alive" tags="" modified="201301301543" created="201301301543" modifier="twee">like a statue of the [[thinker\s|thinking]]\nI am living i the past\n[[trying]] not to think on [[purpose]]\nto [[pretend]] there's [[bliss\s|sweet]] in that\nas ignorance is happiness\nand knowledge the [[abyss\s|consume]]\nI'll chose to be [[feral]]\nor at least [[be]] [[me]] - but which?</div><div tiddler="fathom" tags="" modified="201301301404" created="201301301404" modifier="twee">the deep. something [[feral]].\ni want to [[disappear]]\nbe persona non grata\njust [[watch]] as i [[feel|emotions]]\ntoo many [[emotions]]\ncan't keep it all\nstraight [[...]]\n\nyou can't [[understand]].\nthis old weathered thinking.\ni'm blinking. it's shrinking,\nexpressions [[emotions]]\nnot like we have [[choices]]\nbut at least I'm [[thinking]] -\n\ncan't fathom or concieve it,\nit's all I can do\nto believe it.</div><div tiddler="Start" tags="" modified="201301241946" created="201301241946" modifier="twee">[[rererere]]\n\n[[intro]]\n\n[[credits]]</div><div tiddler="see" tags="" modified="201301301352" created="201301301352" modifier="twee">I think I see [[everything]],\neven though it's [[nothing]] -\nall i want is [[something]]\nbut i'm just [[meandering]]\nuntil i can find a way to fake [[glee]]</div><div tiddler="stasis3" tags="" modified="201301312131" created="201301312131" modifier="twee">[[stuck in\s|stasis1]] [[a\s|feral]] [[loop\s|stasis1]]\n[[of our\s|stasis2]] [[own\s|me]] [[devising\s|stasis2]]\n[[too clever\s|stasis3]] [[by\s|covet]] [[halves\s|stasis3]]\n[[unmoving yet\s|stasis4]] [[binding\s|purpose]]\n\n[[hint]]</div><div tiddler="stasis4" tags="" modified="201302020204" created="201302020204" modifier="twee">[[stuck in a\s|stasis1]] [[loop\s|repeat]]\n[[of our own\s|stasis2]] [[devising\s|dream]]\n[[too clever by\s|stasis3]] [[halves\s|disappear]]\n[[unmoving yet binding\s|stasis4]] [[...]]</div><div tiddler="something" tags="" modified="201301301346" created="201301301346" modifier="twee">[[words\s|vomit]]!\nall [[w\s|me]][[e\s|you]] [[need\s|purpose]]\nto feel [[alive]]</div><div tiddler="brittle" tags="" modified="201301301533" created="201301301533" modifier="twee">like candy\nthe bones snap so simply\nconstructed of kindling\nset fire to dwindling\n[[structures\s|autistic]]\n\nno [[idol]]s\nthe bones and the [[trial\s|emotions]]s\n[[meandering]] voices\ntalking around [[choices]]\n\nto circle\nyou can't bend the bones that way\nthey'll shatter\nand the dust will be dead and g[r]ay</div><div tiddler="disappear" tags="" modified="201301301527" created="201301301527" modifier="twee">to [[pretend]]\nthat [[you]] are [[something]] [[different\s|autistic]]\nthan what [[you]] say [[you|me]] are.\n\nto diffuse into [[nothing]]\nand be here, but be quiet;\nbe [[alive]] but silent,\n[[try|trying]] a backbone, but pliant.</div><div tiddler="lie" tags="" modified="201301301403" created="201301301403" modifier="twee">just sit there,\nsay [[nothing]],\nlet everyone [[think\s|thinking]]\nand be [[merry\s|sweet]] with [[longing\s|swooning]]\nwhite lies soothe the soul,\nblack hearts [[scar\s|disfigured]] the coal.</div><div tiddler="what" tags="" modified="201301301530" created="201301301530" modifier="twee">[[who\s|me]]\n[[what\s|emotions]] \n[[why\s|enlightening]]\n[[when\s|brief]]\nwhat\n\nnobody cares about [[where\s|observing]]\n\n[[how\s|meaning]] doesn't even enter the picture.</div><div tiddler="end" tags="" modified="201301301353" created="201301301353" modifier="twee">-----------------------------------------\nthis is the end\n[[Start]] again?</div><div tiddler="enlightening" tags="" modified="201301301528" created="201301301528" modifier="twee">and what do you want?

Everything hurt before, and it just continued to hurt. The theme of the week, I guessed. Not like I wasn't used to things hurting, but usually it was more figurative than this, and I really just wanted to continue the earlier process I'd been following of throwing up my organs into a bucket orally. But I couldn't. Everything hurt than it ever possibly could, everything, but I couldn't sit down. I felt like I was outside of my own body, somehow, floating on a current of air around myself and yet connected, in that I was able to feel every sensation that I felt. And I felt sick. Violently, woefully sick, like how I felt when I had the 'food poisoning', like how I felt when I was there, earlier, like everything was wrong … but there was something else there, from the horror and the pain, something else that was lurking behind it that I didn't quite recognize but later pegged as a note of acceptance, of relief. I felt it, but I didn't feel it.\n	I am paranoid, I am self-involved. I am paying attention to myself and … not only myself. But mostly myself. So everything hurts. Everything hurts enough, even, for me not to notice them. The one, the only, the giant, the overwhelming. The. Too many things overwhelming but when there is enough pain you are able to ignore that until there is a focus there and a clarity. Words fail me in a sense. And I was confused, I was baffled. Why were they here. Why was I a focus of this being.\n	I guess you want to know how they look. I didn't really look, it felt wrong, it felt horrible, but I did attempt to catch a few glimpses when its back was turned, when it was distracted. I know it knows, I wonder what it felt, how funny it may have thought my attempts at abstaining, at giving it respect. Or perhaps it acknowledged them and was glad of it, or perhaps it new all along what would happen and what will happen, reading hints and causality at a level that I was and remain nearly completely unaware of. But I learned a few things, when I looked.\n	Most of what I learned was about its surroundings rather than itself. Looking at it was almost physically painful; it was more of a nothing than a something, a purposefully twisted abomination, at least five times my height – and though it was far enough away that I could barely comprehend its scale, it had appendages, gigantic ones, dozens of feet in length, at least forty streaming through the air on wind currents as though they were weightless; as though it was weightless, while I was very much there and very much had weight pinning me to the ground – my own weight as well as others as well as its taint, as well as its influence controlling me beyond my own will.\n	The walls of the place were purple and exploding in psychadelic colors; at least the parts that I could see. Various animals glowed, letting me see a very little while they crawled around until they were eaten or otherwise extinguished; everything that wasn't a shade of purple [purplish red, purplish black, purplish green … the list continues, but everything had the same pervading purple hue] was black, shrouded, impossible to see. The little of the creature's total body that I was was from a single lit monster who had dared to go slightly too close: it was only lit for a second before the monster seemed to spontaneously shrivel inwards and wither into nothingness on the spot, as though the creature had willed it – or perhaps it hadn't willed it but had just spontaneously destroyed it because it had gotten too close to it, too close to the pervading sense of doom and hopelessness that emanated from its floating maw of a body like I could feel it, death itself, everywhere on me and within me, privately violated and destroyed.\n	But it wasn't a conscious violation, again. It just seemed to be, as though the creature's very presence violated space and time. Mostly. Through the pain I could barely hold my head up, enough that I could listen to it; though it didn't talk in words, more like feelings that it forced me to share, primordial things that I was driven to feel despite myself and thoughts that came, unbidden, to my head. \n	Everything was blurred inside it, but everything was resolving, somehow; and, again, it was getting easier. I fell to the ground, and that's when I realized that I hadn't been standing but I'd been floating there for god knows how long – held up by something, by the creature, perhaps, so they could analyze me – change me – but as I fell to my knees in front of it I realized two things. The first is that my body, recently so intimately known by myself and a constant source of woe to me, had changed. Perhaps this is what the creature was trying to do; perhaps they were an agent of bliss instead of horror. I was naked, but there was no shame in it – nobody was here, of course, except the God, and though I instinctively felt ashamed – at being revealed and at being exposed like this – I mentally girdered myself for it and attempted to ignore it, with some success. I rationalized to myself: If you're going to be stripped naked, it may as well be a god who's doing it.\n	The second is that I was able to stand up. Wobbily, but I was. I got to my feet and looked the creature dead in the eyes, and I could swear that it smiled. I felt some sort of contentment, or perhaps some sort of magical glee. It had gotten what it wanted, whatever that was, whyever that was. And I asked a question with my eyebrows and my head, but daring – or bothering – to use my voice:\n	What do you want?\n\nAnd I fell asleep again, and I woke up in a tunnel.\n\n   The tunnel was fairly unremarkable in most aspects – it generally was a tunnel. The only astonishing things about it were the color – though since everything was that same color, it wasn't terribly offputting, and actually didn't bother me much at all – and the length, which did bother me. I'd been walking for hours and had resorted to wrapping one arm on my chest to balance myself, plodding along through the crisp, cold air, which was causing other physical changes to my body that I didn't particularly appreciate, given the situation. And, paradoxically, I was getting tired, and I wasn't particularly well-balanced at this point – my body an alien thing beyond me, though it somehow felt … right, better than it had before, like something in my brain had been laying dormant all these years and had finally clicked, the last piece of a lego puzzle. And it felt exuberantly satisfying. But I had no chance to celebrate my own awakening and odd method of being saved – I was far too busy attempting to find out just what, exactly, the Old Ones were up to with this. I made a note: as soon as I woke up, I would go to a library, because I had a lot of reading to do. Perhaps not all of it, though. There is a point where attempting to learn more about an affliction becomes an affliction in itself; if you take everything too seriously you eventually become a poisoned amoeba, spreading sickness to everything you touch.\n	And I was dreadfully aware of sickness as I walked down the path's purple sheen. It was all perspectives. It was in one light beautiful, bizarrely so, an aurora borealis underneath the ground and more constrained, the way people take repetition and turn it into art. Carvings, exquisite ones – that are so random that they must have come into existence via evolution, how could these things mean anything? - or perhaps they did to the things that made them, and now they don't, a message taken out of context and left to die.\n	I walked until my legs ached and my arms started to hang from my sides, shuffling forwards. I wasn't hungry, but I was so … so tired. I held out a hand, and attempted to prop myself up against one of the walls, walking forwards again, forwards more, and then I started to lean with my shoulder against it, body leaning against the wall. I didn't care.\n	The walls were not clean. They were alive. Bugs ran across my body: I flailed at the first one, but it easily ran out of my reach, and then more jumped on, exploring, scuttling around in circles, evading my clumsy, exhausted attempts to squish them. I wasn't really trying to squish them for any reason, though – it was just that bugs are disgusting. After about a dozen tries, I finally crushed one with the palm of my hand in a fling – it'd stopped moving and just looked at me, as though it was angry that I was as tired as I was,\n	and when I squished it it almost exploded in blue dust, covering the wall,\n	and when I looked at it the blue part of the wall seemed to suck in on itself,\n	and I leaned against the blue wall to gain my bearings\n	and it, like everything in a story,\n	was color-coded.\n	It was as though there was no wall there at all. I fell into the wall, landed roughly on my shoulder, sprawled on the ground, and it closed up,\n	and then I thought that I'd discovered something,\n	and then I slept.\n\n[[be]]\n[[cont]]</div><div
