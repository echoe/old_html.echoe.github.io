<pre>tides

life
is like
a box of
chocolates
as long as the
candies are black
and the blood filling
siphoned from my veins
drips quiet onto the ground
with frenzied streams of bile -
and if I could get myself to throw
up any more I would stick my fingers
into my throat wholeheartedly
panic with familiar anxiety
everybody is so angry
they all need to calm
down and relax like
we used to at the
old summer house
watching tides
recede</pre>
