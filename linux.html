<h1>Linux:First off ...</h1>
<p>Which distribution? In my opinion, Ubuntu's the easiest. Fedora is 
the most red hat-y, but kind of sucks in regards to updates. Linux Mint 
is okay, but a little ... it just doesn't feel right to me right now. 
Gnome 3 is horrible and if I didn't have to use it, I never would. There are 
really dumb usability things [you have to press alt to display 'shut down' in the 
power menu >.>]. They'll fix it eventually, but geez.</p>
<p>Note: This page is in flux and more will be added as time passes.

<h2>Working in Linux: Things to get</h2>
<p>Parcellite (clipboard manager), Terminator(terminal manager).
LibreOffice if you need the functionality. That's really all you need.
There are some modifications to say Firefox that make it easier [bookmarks],
but they aren't necessary at all.</p>

<h3>Working in Linux: Things to be aware of</h3>

<p>You can't do what you can do really well on Windows and Mac as well as you can 
on Windows and Mac, but you can do other things better. 
Treating a Linux distribution as an inferior Windows or Mac distribution is just 
going to make it worse than either of those. Linux shines when you figure out what 
you can do with it and then do that with Linux. I edit this website with it [now 
...] and do programming with it. It's great for that. I'd be hesitant to do other 
things with it.</p>
<h3>Random COmmands</h3>
<p>top is awesome - you can press h for help and it will show you how to work with 
it. memcached-top is also awesome. SAR seems to be the most important thing to 
know (I still don't). There are a bunch of simple commands that are nice to know - 
scp, mv, cp, ls, rm. (secure copy protocol, move, copy, list, remove.) stat 
will tell you when something was last seen. On some systems ll will tell 
you some stat info for everything in a folder, which is nice. ls is the only one 
that works on this site, though, for instance. I have a massive page of stuff 
that I will take and put on here eventually.</p>
