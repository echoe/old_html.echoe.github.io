<h1>ogre</h1>
<pre>the soul, enriched,
looks so disgusting

if you want,
we can dress up the outside
and smile brokenly

sick lies
are normal
so show how ugly
your beauty
is

gap-toothed sickness
and profane kisses
love in death
hormones in breath

we grew up
covered in shells
that hardened to make
the inside gel

if you're gonna play with magic,
boy you'd better know what you've fallen for
