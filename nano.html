<h1>Nano</h1>

<p>Nano is pretty awesome (it's what I'm using to edit this site) but Nano actually stands for 
NaNoWriMo, otherwise known as National Novel Writing Month. I'm planning on writing a Lovecraftian 
tale of terror. We will see what happens.</p>

<p>Update: I am now 4200 words into my story, tentatively titled 'What Happens When You Miss The 
Ground'. It's an odd amalgam of lovecraft, other things I don't wish to name, jellybeans, 
drunkenness [purple!], and possibly romance [tbd]. More updates as they 
come.</p>

<a href="Nanop1.doc">This is where I am.</a>

<p>Update 2: I failed at this due to work. It will be better later, 
perhaps. I am currently around 12,000 words in.</p>
