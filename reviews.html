<h1>Reviews</h1>

<h2>-My current setup (and small reviews)</h2>
<p>Quickfire Rapid w/blue switches: It's great. Is different (tiny bit worse?) 
than my Das Keyboard that I sold, but it's still good, half the price, and much 
smaller. These are all good things! </p>
<p>I have a Cherry keyboard with black switches. Black switches suck. Seriously. 
Really hard to press down. The keyboard feels like a tank though, which is 
nice.</p>
<p>I have an H2 for recording. Can't get a clean recording out of it, though that 
might just be my surroundings. It's been useful for spot recording once or twice, 
though I don't use it nearly enough.</p>
<p>iPad 2: The iPad 1 is too slow, but the iPas 2 is basically fast enough for 
everything. It's not as beautiful as the iPad 4 but it really does the job 
regardless. I use it to make music [see the music in the 'music' section] when I'm 
not using Ableton or REAPER. I cannot understate how great it is at that. Bad 
at everything else, though ...</p>
<p>Galaxy Nexus: It's fast enough and sleek enough, for sure. I bought it with 
three batteries but battery life complaints seem to have been greatly exaggerated. 
No complaints!</p>
<p>A6-3420 laptop - I bought this off of eBay for a ridiculously cheap price and 
it plays Fallout 3 and other old games. What can you say against that? 17 inch 
screen even! Decent battery life, etc. etc. I have Linux on it now. It's a 
fantastic piece of kit.</p>
<p>Thinkpad x100e: This entire line is great. I use this to just write - or jot 
things down when I'm traveling [oh god the iPad's keyboard sucks] and it works beautifully for 
that, though I needed to install underclocking software. Other versions shouldn't 
have the overheating issue. And, again, very cheap ... relatively.
