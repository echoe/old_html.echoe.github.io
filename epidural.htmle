<h1>epidural</h1>
<pre>head floating in water
your darlings, your daughters!
lie sweetly, lay deeply
that dawning unknowing
all softness and kindness
post-oedipal blindness

brain swimming in ether
not good for the baby
brain pooling in fever
sleep before we're crazy

such openings widening
such beginnings biding
such floating half-madness
such lies and sadness
deceit, it will never be!
sickness, not ovaries
