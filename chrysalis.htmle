<pre>chrysalis

i've a blossom in me that nobody knows
an expectant flower waits as the sun glows
though hidden down under cover of darkness
with ignorant hopes that the blossom will die
if it feeds on nothing but salt when I cry
hope it withers and stagnates as a dead cyst

but i hope the blossom grows parasitically
sucks the bloom from my body the blood from my lips
sucks the life from my flesh and the lunar eclipse
just let me lie forever dead and alone
in the bottom of someone's deserted tomb
i'll excavate my own place to inhabit
and all of you can stay away from me

why emerge and destroy the illusion of self
all paths lead to death all paths lead to death
my heart expands growing surely inwards
within the safe cocoon
the heart's vessels become crazy figures

until i lose myself in the mass of bodies
become everyone else, complaining, ornery
but the carapace stays and the blossom's not gone
as long as I live I will keep to the shadows
to strangle its growth and pretend to be facile
but the carapace stays and the blossom's not gone

trapped in shadows in shadows lengthening lengthening
like a summer sunset slickening slickening
a winter front moving in like a bad dream
melding to myself endlessly there's no identity
here we are everything, nothing, whatever we
want; as long as we maintain the scream</pre>
